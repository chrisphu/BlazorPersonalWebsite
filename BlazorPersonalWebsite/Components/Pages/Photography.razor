<Paragraph>
    I started getting into photography in late September 2024. Although maybe not exactly an advisable first camera body
    for a beginner, I had opted to buy a used 
    <Link LinkText="SIGMA sd Quattro"
                  Href="https://www.sigmaphoto.com/sd-quattro-camera" />
    (and a 
    <Link LinkText="SIGMA SA-7N"
                  Href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/sa-7n/" />
    shortly after).

    For convenience, most of my photos are still being hosted on
    <Link LinkText="Instagram"
                  Href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisnguyenphu" />.
    I'll work out a workflow for hosting them here as well at some point!

    Why add emulated film grain to digital photos?
